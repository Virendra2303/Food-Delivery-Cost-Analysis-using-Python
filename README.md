## Description:

This project delves into the world of online Food delivery sales by analyzing a dataset from Statso. Using Python libraries and guided by data science principles, we will identify areas where the service can reduce costs and increase revenue. This exploration will aid in understanding market dynamics and potentially inform strategic business decisions.

### Technologies:
**Python (Data analysis and visualization) Libraries:** Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Analysis
**1)compare total revenue, total costs, and total profit (net loss in our case)**:

### Conclusion:
From the analysis so far we understood that the discounts on food orders are resulting in huge losses. Now, we need to find a new strategy for profitability.
